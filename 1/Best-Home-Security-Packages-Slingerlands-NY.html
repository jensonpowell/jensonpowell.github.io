<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
