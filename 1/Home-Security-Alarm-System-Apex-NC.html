<h3>Highest Rated Home Security Systems in North Carolina</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader area and for that reason provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Windows and door sensing units are contact motion sensing units that activate an alarm when the secured door or window opens. Like stand-alone motion detectors, these can trigger when you're far from home or whenever you choose. For example, you might keep the window sensing units always activated but deactivate the door sensors when you're at home. These sensors can function as part of your security system or by themselves, and they differ in size and design from small, streamlined sensing units to large and apparent. Sensing units also differ in sensitivity. Some may activate when the door or window vibrates versus really opening.</p>
