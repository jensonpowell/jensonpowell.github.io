<p>Wired security cameras use cables to transmit video and conduct video surveillance, but the signal can compromise when the transmission variety exceeds 300 meters.

The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the person being viewed understand they're being enjoyed, and you can choose to record video clips or images and save them to your clever device on an impulse.</p>
