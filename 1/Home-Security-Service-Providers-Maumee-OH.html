<h3>Outside Security Cameras Maumee OH 43537</h3>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cable televisions. DVR systems are hard to scale up because when every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to buy a totally new DVR before including another camera to the system.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
