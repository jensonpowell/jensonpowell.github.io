<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide simple DIY installation, other companies use (and in some cases require) expert installation. Expert installation is available for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end. And while this is a quite standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you might also need a neighboring outlet. A lot of cameras need an Air Conditioning connection, which implies you won't have the ability to place them simply anywhere. Numerous of the cameras we evaluated provided the option to use battery power, however we have yet to find the perfect one. The models we've reviewed up until now either record really short clips, leave huge spaces in between those short clips, or require charging regularly.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
