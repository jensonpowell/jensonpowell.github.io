<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on created to address the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
