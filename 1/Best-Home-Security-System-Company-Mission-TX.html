Typically, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is a lot of readily available light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being missing or low (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Since they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality elements that can adapt and record outstanding low light video, commercial cameras outshine their cheaper cousins.</p>
