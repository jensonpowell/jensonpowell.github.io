<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating costly incorrect alarms.

Operators might likewise start calling a list of telephone number offered by the consumer to contact somebody to go examine the secured properties. Some zones might activate a call to the local heating oil company to go check on the system, or a call to the owner with information of which space might be getting flooded. Some alarm are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be immediately shown on a remote monitor, not to discuss tape-recorded.</p>
