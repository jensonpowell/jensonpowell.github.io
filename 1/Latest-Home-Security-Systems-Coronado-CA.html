<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
