<p>Besides resolution, also consider the field of vision. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are produced equal.

<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
