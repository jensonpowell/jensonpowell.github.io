<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however extensive modifications to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they might be seen at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals might learn to be careful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, members or hookers." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the environments went through extended surveillance.</p>
