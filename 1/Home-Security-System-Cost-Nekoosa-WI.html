The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to fix detail after the fact, which implies that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of taping storage area. A lot, in reality, that they need about 4 times the hard drive space of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is essential.</p>
