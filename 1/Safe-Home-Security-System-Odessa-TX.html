We have actually seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts!

<p>Watch this video to see the Windows software application used to remotely view HD security cameras.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions.
