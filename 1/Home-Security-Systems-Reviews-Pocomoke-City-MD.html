<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
