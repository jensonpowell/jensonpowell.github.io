The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was defective, therefore we might revisit this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud. The broad face of the camera provides you an excellent field of vision, and the image you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.)
