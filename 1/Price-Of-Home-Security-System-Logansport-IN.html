<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, should provide at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more readily available for a monthly cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will enable the camera to appropriately detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, however it might leave you with recording spaces during important security events. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd advise one of our top choices, but the Arlo is great for checking in on household and family pets-- or roaming felines slipping around your backyard.</p>
