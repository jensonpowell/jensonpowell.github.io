Another area where Arlo stands out is customer service. After long-term testing this camera since we initially made it a choice in 2016, we noticed that our Arlo Q began forecasting a pink tint, which seems to be a continuous problem for some owners.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
