<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Tenants, unlike house owners, normally avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive.
