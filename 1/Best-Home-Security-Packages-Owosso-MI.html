<p>B.

<p>While not a necessary requirement for a home security system, all top companies use a variety of camera options as add-ons. Homeowners can select from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can tape-record footage when an alarm is triggered, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, baby-sitter cameras, and more. All of these cameras can be incorporated into the overall system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic understanding of alarm systems is helpful.

<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a really typical kind of two piece sensor that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or typically closed when under the influence of a magnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the 2nd piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, again based upon whether or not the style is typically open or normally closed. This action combined with an electric existing (generally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control board to spot a fault on that zone or circuit.
