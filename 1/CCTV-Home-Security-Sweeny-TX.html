<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it ought to be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
