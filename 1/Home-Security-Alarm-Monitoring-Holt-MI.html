<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the precise same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which means. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system.
