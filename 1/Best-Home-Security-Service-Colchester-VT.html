<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've identified (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>

If clever home security is what you want, we advise checking out Vivint or ADT before jumping on the more affordable, DIY bandwagon. However if your primary objective is keeping crooks out of your house and protecting your property, you do not require to invest a bundle.</p>
