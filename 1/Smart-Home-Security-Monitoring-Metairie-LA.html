<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a quick description of how thermal cameras work: All things emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
