<p>Home security systems and modern smart home capabilities and compatibilities enable you to tap into their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a design that uses a high resolution (1080p), a wide angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range approximately 25 feet, and budget-friendly cloud storage for tape-recorded video.
