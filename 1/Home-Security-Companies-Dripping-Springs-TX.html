<p>Nurse calling systems usually include emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station if a client is having problem. This is an easy switch that is generally open or normally closed. Most of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and informs, sensing units, access control, and so on.
