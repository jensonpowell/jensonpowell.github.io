<p>You might believe you'll never be targeted, but why take the opportunity? An estimated 2,000,000 burglaries take place in the United States every year. Theft prevention is an essential preventative measure to guarantee the safety of your belongings. A burglar alarm can serve several functions to this end. In some cases, its presence can function as a deterrent-- robbers are less apt to target a spot where it is most likely that they will come across such disturbance. In other circumstances, when they go through with the act, the alarm can serve to alert individuals in the area (along with the authorities) that something is wrong. This ensures a rapid reaction and decreases the burglar's chances of success.</p>
<p>Cameras that tape big areas of the general public are broad in scope, tape-recording everything and everybody within their reach. These cameras record everyone similarly: the general public going about their everyday activities, and crooks who likely shield or blend themselves in to avoid being recorded or spotted.
