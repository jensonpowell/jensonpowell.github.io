Hard disk storage is safe, secure, and convenient, with many systems providing growth and free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll need to by hand eliminate to transfer the information? Does it go to your smartphone, or upload to services like Dropbox?
