<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We must once again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates.

If  police are called for a false alarm, house owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly.
