<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And despite having an attractive rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>

<p>When your video cameras are set up, you can select whether your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you pick to have your cameras monitored (this is typically done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is tape-recorded when an alarm is activated.

Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the customer.</p>

For instance, you can have a wise plug turn on a light indoors or activate an external siren when the camera identifies motion.</p>
