Commercial-grade cameras are created and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Usually, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is a lot of available light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being low or missing (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
