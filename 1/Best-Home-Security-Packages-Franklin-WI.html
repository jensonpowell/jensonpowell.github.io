<p>so state you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I recommend to have cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras provide an obvious sign for anybody who passes by that they are being recorded on CCTV and this can be an excellent deterrent of theft and criminal offense. Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a bigger area such as your front or back garden and can follow motion with ease.</p>

<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to use as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve.
