<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the whole household will love. ADT is a household name, so we often try out their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our most current round of testing, we realized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty hectic with nifty smart home functions. We especially liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
<p>On top of home security equipment, Vivint provides many clever home items for their customers. Monitoring services featured a 5-year agreement. All equipment is purchased in advance. Intercom Keypads: Some keypads provide two-way intercoms between your home and the security monitoring company. Therefore, instead of calling your landline to validate an alarm signal, they speak to you straight through the keypad utilizing an intercom system.

<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over two months. Scout is extremely simple to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it permits you to manage practically every element of the security system from another location, and it's extremely adjustable.

When an alarm is set off and view video from any of the set up security cameras, the display screen lets you communicate with a professional monitoring service.</p>
