For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment in this manner to make consumers stick with them longer, because changing monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for clients.

On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
