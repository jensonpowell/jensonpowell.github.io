<p>Twenty-five years back, basic and business communications were mainly simultaneous. To accomplish almost anything, somebody live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when dealing with global and nationwide business. The same is true for security and video surveillance.

<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge a violation.

Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
