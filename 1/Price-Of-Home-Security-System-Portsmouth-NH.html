We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting eight times over two months. Scout is very simple to use, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it permits you to control almost every element of the security system remotely, and it's highly adjustable.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
