<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
