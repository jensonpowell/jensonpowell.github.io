<p>Think about it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced video camera be cost the low cost of forty dollars?

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be considered.

The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers call into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense prevention created to avoid both individual and property criminal offense and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011).
