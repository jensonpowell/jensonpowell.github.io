<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, centers, and others. Some people might say that we must not have surveillance cameras in public places. They claim that they invade personal privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you desire privacy? Surveillance cameras are indicated to keep you and other home safe, not to stalk you.

<p>Essentially, a wireless security system is consisted of alarms, sensors, cameras, and numerous detectors all connected to a main control panel via radio signals. For instance, a four-camera system that runs 24 hr a day utilizing IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage space for video, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically through 110VAC power.</p>
