<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
