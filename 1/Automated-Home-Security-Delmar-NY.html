The first guard showed up early so he could take a look at the whole location and speak with me about my issues. He was professional, very encouraging and polite. The second guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the morning to get the event started, he was also expert, reassuring and polite.

Once after leaving our property in your hands, I didn't fret.</p>
