<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level.
