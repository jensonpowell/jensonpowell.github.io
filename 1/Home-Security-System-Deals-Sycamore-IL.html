<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
