<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control board (usually positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to arm and deactivate the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, wise alarms are managed from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have been activated, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially irritating your neighbours).

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
