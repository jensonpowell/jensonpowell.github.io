Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for thirty days.

These kinds of cameras typically utilize rechargeable batteries that can be easily popped out and taken inside your home for charging with a USB cable television, but they tend to drain pipes rapidly in colder weather condition.
