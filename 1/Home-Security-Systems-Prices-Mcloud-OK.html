<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a sensational worth. It gets an Outstanding rating for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage.
