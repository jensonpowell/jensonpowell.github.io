<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night.
