No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.

<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their portability, impermanence and expandability. Renters, unlike house owners, typically avoid making long-term changes to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can easily be set up at various homes later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new parts too.
