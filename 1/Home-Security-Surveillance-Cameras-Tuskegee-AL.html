<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
