Wyze's just recently introduced Complete Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't recommend that for home security since if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
