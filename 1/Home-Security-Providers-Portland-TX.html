<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
