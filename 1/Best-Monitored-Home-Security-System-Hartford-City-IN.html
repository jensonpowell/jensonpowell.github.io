False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen regularly enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
