<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of free storage, and utilize two AA batteries that can last as much as two years. Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink does not provide you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you.

Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
