Rather, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by.
