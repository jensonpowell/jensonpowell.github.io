The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we might revisit this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of footage to the cloud.

Simply a couple decades earlier, the home security industry was controlled by a couple of big names offering costly, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-term contracts.
