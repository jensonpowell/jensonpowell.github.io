Whereas dome cameras are smaller sized and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a bigger location such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>
<p>Besides resolution, also think about the field of view. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, however not all angles are developed equivalent.

Rather, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't deactivate it, it can't do things that a regular self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or set off the siren.
