<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower criminal activity. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image.

We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, and so we may revisit this review. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video to the cloud.
