<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
