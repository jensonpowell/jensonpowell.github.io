<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
