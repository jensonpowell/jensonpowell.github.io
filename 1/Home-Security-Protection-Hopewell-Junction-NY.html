Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automated home devices are by their very nature wireless, and most home security companies use a home automation package with an app to remotely manage whatever on the system. That isn't to say that you can't have wired home automation, due to the fact that you can, however automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to secure. It isn't extremely clever. Wireless gadgets interact more safely and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you choose monitoring).</p>
