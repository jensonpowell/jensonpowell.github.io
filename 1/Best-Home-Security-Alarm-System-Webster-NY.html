<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
