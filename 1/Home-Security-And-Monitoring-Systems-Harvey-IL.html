<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to police ability to collar robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers fund cops action to alarmed homes) a pricey and ineffective  technique to burglary reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
