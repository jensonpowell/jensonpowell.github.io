<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
