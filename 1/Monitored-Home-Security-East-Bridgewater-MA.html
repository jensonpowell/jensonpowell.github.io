IP cameras work by utilizing an IP (IP means internet protocol) network, often the very same data network the rest of a company uses. If bandwidth is a problem, a separate network using classification 5 wiring can be used. In either case, video details is taped on a server, which indicates video information can be located on site or in a remote place. After testing, we sent each of our top picks, along with the Wyze Cam v2, to Costs McKinley, head of details security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening.

In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a private guard. A number of cities also need a permit to even operate a home and own security system. Rules such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>
