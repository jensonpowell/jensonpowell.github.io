<p>Flood lights are often used in combination with motion detectors. When sensing units detect motion, the lights illuminate the surrounding location, which will allow you to see who is on your home and will possibly frighten intruders.

Flood lights can discourage vandals or frighten them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your comfort than for home protection.</p>
