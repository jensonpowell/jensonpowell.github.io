<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, vandalism, and theft. Tip: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed.

For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it instantly switch off the heating systems.
