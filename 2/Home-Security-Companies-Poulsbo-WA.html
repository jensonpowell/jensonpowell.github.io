Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
