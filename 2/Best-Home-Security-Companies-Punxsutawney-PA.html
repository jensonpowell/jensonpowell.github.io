<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in areas where they are believed to be most reliable, which normally consists of highly inhabited towns, city centers, car parks, or numerous other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008).
