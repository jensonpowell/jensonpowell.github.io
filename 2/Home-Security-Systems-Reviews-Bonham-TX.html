<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF certified, which implies you can use several various third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera deal with other ONVIF-compliant devices. Our company believe alarm systems work best when incorporated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and access control.

Typically, the bullet CCTV camera type is small, which could be 2.5 to 3 inches long decided by the CCTV camera lens types.
