<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
