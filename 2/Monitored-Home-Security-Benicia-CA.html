<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensing units, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies created are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
