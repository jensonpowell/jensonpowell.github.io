In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security guard. A number of cities also need a permit to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are created to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Numerous towns will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>
