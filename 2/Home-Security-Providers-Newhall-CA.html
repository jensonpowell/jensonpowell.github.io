<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate in between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a normal camera image. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to solve detail after the reality, which implies that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of recording storage area. So much, in reality, that they need about four times the hard disk area of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage. If extended video storage is important, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
