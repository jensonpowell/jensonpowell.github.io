<p>Seeing angle: The camera's field of view figures out just how much it can see. As you're most likely monitoring a single space, you want a wide viewing angle.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
