<h3>Install Security System Effingham IL 62401</h3>
<p>There are two main types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet protocol (IP) cameras and the traditional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more contemporary iteration of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a little more costly, they offer a number of features that analog cameras do not.
