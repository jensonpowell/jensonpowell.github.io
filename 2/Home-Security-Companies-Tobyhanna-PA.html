<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a terrific security camera and an extraordinary worth. It gets an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on created to resolve the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that knows the secrets can read all the traffic.</p>
