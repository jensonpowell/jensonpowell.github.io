Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by.
