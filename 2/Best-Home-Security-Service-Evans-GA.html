<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the obligation of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you plan to keep and for how long you prepare to keep taped video.

There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
