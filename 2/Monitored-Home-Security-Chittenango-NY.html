Furthermore, the general viewpoint is that the company's customer service is not really valuable when it pertains to repairing issues and recurring usage issues.

<p>This self monitored alarm has four smart modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Personal. Based upon that, the camera switches on or off depending on your area.

<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting.
