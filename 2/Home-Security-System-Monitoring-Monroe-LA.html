What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in best conditions like brilliant sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in particular scenarios such as baby-sitter webcams or signing in on a family pet, though when seeking to collect proof of a criminal offense they frequently come up short.</p>
