Instead, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you walk by.
