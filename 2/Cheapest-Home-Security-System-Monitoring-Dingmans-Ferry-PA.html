However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal security personnel. A number of cities also require an authorization to even own and run a home security system. Rules such as these are created to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>

If you cancel early-- and some need 100%, many home security companies will charge you around 75% of the staying term of your agreement.</p>
