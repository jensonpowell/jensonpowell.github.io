<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious.

Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
