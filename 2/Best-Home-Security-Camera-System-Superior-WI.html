<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
