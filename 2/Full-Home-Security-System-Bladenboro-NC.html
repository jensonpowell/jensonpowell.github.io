<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor.

Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
