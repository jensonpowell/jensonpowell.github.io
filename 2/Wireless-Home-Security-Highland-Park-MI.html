The camera can tape-record video in as much as 1080p, which looks perfectly great on a smartphone screen and won't tax your internet connection too much. Netatmo likewise enables you to fine tune the settings for each private user - for example, don't tape Abbie, however do record Ben. It's actually quite clever.</p>

When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
