<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
