As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
