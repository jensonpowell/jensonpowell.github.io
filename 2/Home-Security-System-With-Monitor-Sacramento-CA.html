<h3>Monitored Home Alarm Systems Sacramento CA 95823</h3>
<p>Nurse calling systems typically include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's restroom. If a patient is having trouble, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a simple switch that is generally open or typically closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and informs, sensors, gain access to control, and so on. My mind conceived an approach of not just offering the customer with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their antiquated nurse call station system.</p>
