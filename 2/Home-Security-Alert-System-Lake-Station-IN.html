<h3>Digital Home Security in Indiana</h3>
<p>Because it's more complicated than it ought to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
