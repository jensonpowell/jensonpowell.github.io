As soon as any alarm system integrated into the PCU was activated, the nearest camera to that area would be shown on that specific monitor. The opportunity that the repaired camera would be pointed in the direction of the incident depends upon the initial requirements for area of coverage. If there are 3 select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single fixed camera can just see one. This creates a one in 3 chance of capturing a particular incident on video (either live or recorded). The command center also included a computer system designated for filing incident reports online.
