The typical reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing an opportunity for the malicious enemy to tape-record these codes and use various splitting tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system.
