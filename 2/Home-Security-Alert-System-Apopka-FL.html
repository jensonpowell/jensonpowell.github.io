<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
