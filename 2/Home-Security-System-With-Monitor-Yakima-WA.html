<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 organisations, universities, and government centers, and residential consumers. After investigating 4 various security systems, we picked SSA. They provided us the very best description of their services and provided us more for the money. After having a disappointment with the local installer for ADT and canceling them, we experienced what a really expert installation should be. We feel very safe knowing our home is secured by SSA. The New Providence Authorities Department is committed to making use of every resource to avoid and fix crimes and to protect citizens and their property.

A wireless bridge is a great option for long range situations where poles and trees are not present.</p>
