<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
