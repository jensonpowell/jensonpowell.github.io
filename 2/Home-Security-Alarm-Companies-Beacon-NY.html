<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
