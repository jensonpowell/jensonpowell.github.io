<p>Nurse calling systems generally include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station if a client is having problem. This is an easy switch that is normally open or usually closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and notifies, sensors, access control, and so on. My mind conceived an approach of not only supplying the client with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>
