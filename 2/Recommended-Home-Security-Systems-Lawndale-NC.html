Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might show a 360-degree view, however the best security cameras have a view of a minimum of 100 degrees or much better. After reading the talk about this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they provided; they've partnered with another security company and their starter plan I believe starts at $0 down.

<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and absolutely like it. Great clarity. I wished to set up seeing on my mobile phone but had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what offers the video history and smarter informs, for example. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively steep rate: $5 per month ($50 per year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 annually) for 30 days of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the preliminary charge.
