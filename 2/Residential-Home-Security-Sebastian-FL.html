<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
