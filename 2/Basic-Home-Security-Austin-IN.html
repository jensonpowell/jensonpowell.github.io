It's one of the best systems we've checked, with customizable alarm activates and constant monitoring action times. We also found it simple to establish, scalable to big and small homes, and configurable with a range of devices, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensors to leak and temperature sensors.

<p>SimpliSafe may be too minimal for you if you have a larger home or residential or commercial property you want to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is terrific for keeping an eye on visitors and package shipments, but it leaves other parts of your lawn susceptible. This system might not be the best fit if you have a big lawn or outbuildings to safeguard. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not need a base station-- it connects straight to any Wi-Fi network. But you can connect the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser. Aside from offering simple access to recordings, the app permits you to adjust sensitivity so that you're not getting alerts every 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
