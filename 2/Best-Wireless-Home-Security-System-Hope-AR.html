<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
