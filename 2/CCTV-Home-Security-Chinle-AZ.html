<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, should provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will enable the camera to effectively spot motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop.

Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is very important.</p>
