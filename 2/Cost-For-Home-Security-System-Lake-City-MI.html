<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to properly discover motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it may leave you with recording spaces during crucial security occasions.
