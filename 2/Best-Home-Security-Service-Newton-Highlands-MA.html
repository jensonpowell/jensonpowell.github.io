The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
