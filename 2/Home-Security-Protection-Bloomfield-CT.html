In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
