You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "people might discover to be cautious about the periodicals and books they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, hookers or members."
