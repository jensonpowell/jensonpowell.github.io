<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
