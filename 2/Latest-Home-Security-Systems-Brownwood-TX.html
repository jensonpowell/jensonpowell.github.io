The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
