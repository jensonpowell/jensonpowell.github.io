<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to police capability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund authorities response to alarmed homes) a inefficient and costly technique to robbery reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
