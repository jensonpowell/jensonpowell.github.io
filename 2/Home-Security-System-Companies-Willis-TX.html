<h3>Cheap Home Security in Texas</h3>

<p>Bullet cameras are tube-shaped and compact. The housing, camera, and lens are all packaged within in a cylindrical-style body.

The models we've reviewed up until now either record really brief clips, leave giant spaces in between those brief clips, or require charging regularly.</p>
<p>The 2nd wireless function has to do with how your security system communicates with the alarm monitoring station.
