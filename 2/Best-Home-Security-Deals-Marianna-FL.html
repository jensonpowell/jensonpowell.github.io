As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
