A Web procedure camera is a digital video camera that sends and receives information through a computer system network. This differs from a CCTV camera, which can just send out and receive signals through a cable connected to a DVR.</p>
<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disturbance concept based on 2 unshielded (or 'leaking') coax cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter gives off continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable television. When the change in field strength damages due to the existence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is produced. The system is covert after installation. Care should be required to make sure the surrounding soil offers good drain in order to avoid annoyance alarms.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
