This unit is what communicates with all of the security sensing units and smart-home components in your house. Many connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, positioning is more flexible. Contact sensors are the very first thing you must buy along with the base station; these connect to windows and doors and will inform you when they open.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
