<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation. As soon as a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
