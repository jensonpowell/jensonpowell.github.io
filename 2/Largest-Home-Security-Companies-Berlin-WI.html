<p>Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through using a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a device is comparable in functionality to a PC with a capture card and suitable video recording software Unlike PCs, many DVRs developed for CCTV functions are ingrained gadgets that need less maintenance and easier setup than a PC-based option, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras.
