<p>During the night, though it does not have the full IR LED range of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight available if you're placing it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not just is the Arlo fast to select moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's looking at. Just a couple decades ago, the home security market was controlled by a few big names providing costly, rigid strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-term agreements.
