Now, most security systems include a multitude of parts, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensors, a keypad, and essential fobs, among other elements.

<p>There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving things if it spots an intruder; a helpful intercom function that allows the device to function as a wise doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.
