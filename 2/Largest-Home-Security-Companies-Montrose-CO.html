<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
