<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating sophisticated wise home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I checked, consisting of smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
