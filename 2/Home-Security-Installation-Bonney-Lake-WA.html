<p>What PTZ cameras lack in strength, they make up for in flexibility.

<p>Another crucial topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
