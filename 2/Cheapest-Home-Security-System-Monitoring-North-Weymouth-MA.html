<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make customers stay with them longer, because switching monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software and firmware.

PoE switches are also normally considered a more secure way to transmit data.</p>
