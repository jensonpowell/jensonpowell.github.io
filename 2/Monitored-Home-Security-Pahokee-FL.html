<p>Home security must never be limited by where you can put or power your cameras, indoors or outdoors. The Ring Base Station lets you link Ring Alarm elements so that you can monitor them through the Ring App. The Ring Base Station also incorporates with Alexa-enabled devices.

<p>There's no devoted center included here - each camera links directly to your router through Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a cool solution, or a minimum of one that saves a power socket and an Ethernet port, however we can't help but feel it's also the factor for the Swann's slightly slow response times. Numerous new security companies are designed for DIY installation only. ADT stays old-fashioned by setting up each security system themselves.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
