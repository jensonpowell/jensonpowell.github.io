Sometimes, anyone could open an internet browser window and view a camera's live video stream and witness the plate records in real time. We had the ability to track the cameras to their sources in five various instances. Similar ALPR vulnerabilities were found in Boston by DigBoston and the Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism.</p>
<p>One of the very best aspects of this alarm is that it has an extremely sophisticated motion sensing unit.

There's no latency so you get informed right away so you can take instant actions such as triggering a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to talk to the prospective burglars.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection.
