<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
